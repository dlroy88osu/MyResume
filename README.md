# Resume


## Summary

I started my work life in hospitality as a chef then sous chef, restaurant manager, front of house, back of house, all of it. When the pandemic hit in 2020, I pivoted to the boat yard, leveraging my procurement and inventory skills to stay employed because sitting at home wasn't an option. Earned my Google IT certification, discovered I loved the problem-solving side of tech, and never looked back. Self-taught Python developer with a knack for web scraping, data engineering, and ETL pipelines. I get genuine satisfaction from automating tedious processes and building systems that just work.
